	<p class = "left">Heavily inspired by 'The Useless Web<a href = "https://theuselessweb.com/" target="_blank"><sup>[?]</sup></a>' and 'Free Real Estate<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4-UnU8lWY" target = "_blank"><sup>[?]</sup></a>', this website is to remember what we TV generation people were perpetually exposed to in the past, and also to share them with people who encountered them online and got curious what they are all about.
	</p>
	<p class = "right">Infomercials bring us back similar memories and feelings. They were annoying, they were unnecessarily long, most of the products seemed dodgy, and actors were always playing either the very depressed characters in black and white (because they’ve never discovered the product), or the extremely exaggeratedly happy characters who found the joy of life from TV infomercial products. Quality of the video was relatively poor as if there was a secret agreement to make it look crappy between people who made the video. On the other hand, it had such unique wacky charm that made us actually feel very curious about the products they were advertising. They were continually made and spread around the globe with, again, hideously poor voice dubs.</p> 

	<p class = left>‘Bored?’ would like to bring those mixed feelings back to you, just like how you used to change around the channels when there was nothing good on TV, ending up watching absurd infomercials. And also would like to encourage you to participate and share your very own memory with infomercials from wherever you have grown up. “?” button on the right top of each page will help you participate. I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
